## Applied Learning Project

This Specialization will equip you with machine learning basics and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques needed to build cutting-edge NLP systems:

  â€¢ Use logistic regression, naÃ¯ve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, translate words, and use locality-sensitive hashing to approximate nearest neighbors.

  â€¢ Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.

  â€¢ Use dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow and Trax to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions. 

  â€¢ Use encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, question-answering, and to build chatbots. Learn T5, BERT, transformer, reformer, and more with ðŸ¤—  Transformers!
